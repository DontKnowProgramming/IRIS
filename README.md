This coursework presents the comprehensive product, technical, and financial feasibility analysis of IRIS, the flagship Web System Information Management (WSIM) platform developed and engineered by O.P.L. Teams. The study provides an in-depth assessment of the system’s concept, market positioning, functional features, target users, technical architecture, and projected financial sustainability. The analysis examines how IRIS supports organizations in transitioning from manual processes to a centralized digital environment, thereby strengthening operational efficiency and system reliability.
IRIS Technology is designed as a unified digital ecosystem that consolidates human resource processes, departmental documentation, content administration, and secure system management into a scalable web-based platform. As a technopreneur venture, O.P.L. Teams recognized the entrepreneurial opportunity in the current landscape where many SMEs are shifting from paper-driven workflows to digital operations. 
The technology addresses persistent inefficiencies created by fragmented tools and traditional record-keeping practices, positioning O.P.L. Teams as innovative technology developers who combine technical expertise with business acumen. 
By offering a centralized, secure, and automated environment as a commercial solution, IRIS aims to assist SMEs in modernizing their administrative infrastructure while adhering to industry standards and national data privacy regulations, demonstrating the team's commitment to creating market-ready, revenue-generating technology products.
